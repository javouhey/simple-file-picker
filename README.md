# Summary

This project provides an embeddable **sdcard** browser with the purpose
of picking a file. It doesn't support directory picking. Currently the browser is rooted at `/sdcard` (i.e. user cannot browse to `/`). See [screenshots](https://github.com/javouhey/simple-file-picker/wiki/Screenshots)

# How to use 

From your Activity, you can request for the file browser by broadcasting this intent:

        import com.raverun.filebrowser.util.Constants;
            
        Intent intent = new Intent( Constants.ACTION_PICK_FILE );
        intent.putExtra( Intent.EXTRA_TITLE, "Select bookmarks file" );
        startActivityForResult( intent, 2 );

Then in your `Activity#onActivityResult`, you will receive the an instance of `java.io.File` that refers to the selected file. Please consult the code in `com.raverun.filebrowser.Main`.
